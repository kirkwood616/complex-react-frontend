## Live Site

[https://complexbuild.netlify.app/](https://complexbuild.netlify.app/)

This site is hosted on Netlify on the free starter tier. If the site hasn't been active recently, it may take about 15 minutes for the server to start up. If so, this may make the site appear as if it is glitching or not working properly. Please note that if the site appears to not be functioning correctly, the server starting back up is the cause and will resume normal functionality after a 5-15 minute period.

## Overview

This is a twitter-esque application to make and view posts. You can register and log in with an account using a username & password.

- When logged in you will see your feed with posts from other users you are following.

- Users will have a personalized avatar if the email used to register their account is tied to [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com).

- The 'Your Profile' section will show all of your posts, users who follow you and what users you are following.
- There is a search feature that will find posts from you and other users.
- There is also a community chat feature where any user that is logged in can send and receive chat messages with one another.

This is an app built from the Udemy course "React For The Rest Of Us" by Brad Schiff.
